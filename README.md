# 🍽️ Restaurant Ordering & Management System

> Full-stack graduation project developed using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It covers client-server architecture, authentication, RESTful API design, error handling, deployment readiness, and more.

---

## ✅ Technical Coverage

### 1. Internet Programming Fundamentals & Networking
- Client-server architecture (React on `3000`, Express on `3001`)
- Axios handles HTTP requests (e.g., `/api/auth/login`)
- Stateless communication using JWT in headers
- Uses HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, DNS (localhost)

### 2. Version Control
- Git & GitHub used for tracking
- `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules`, `env`
- Structured separation: `frontend/` & `backend/`

### 3. Application Structure & Framework
- MVC pattern in backend (`controllers`, `models`, `routes`)
- Component-based architecture in React

### 4. Dependency Injection & Routing
- Modular Express routing with injected controllers
- Frontend routing via React Router & protected routes

### 5. Handling Requests, Responses, & Model Binding
- `express.json()` parses requests
- Clean JSON responses with correct status codes
- Mongoose schema validates and structures input data

### 6. Data Validation & API Design Patterns
- **Formik + Yup** on frontend
- **Mongoose** for backend validation
- RESTful APIs with standard routes and responses

### 7. Error Handling & Logging
- Try-catch blocks in backend
- `morgan` for HTTP logs
- User-friendly error messages on frontend

### 8. Database Integration & ORM Usage
- MongoDB Atlas for cloud data storage
- Mongoose ODM for schema management
- Async operations with `async/await`

### 9. RESTful API Design & Versioning
- Clean endpoint structure (`/api/auth/register`, etc.)
- Uses semantic HTTP methods and correct status codes

### 10. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based auth, tokens stored in localStorage
- Role-based access control (admin, staff, customer)
- AuthContext for managing auth state in frontend

### 11. Asynchronous Programming & Performance Optimization
- All API and DB operations are async
- Promises with Axios
- Frontend remains responsive during calls

### 12. (Optional) Microservices Architecture
- Modular structure prepared for separation of concerns
- Separate auth logic and future service boundaries

### 13. Security Best Practices
- Passwords hashed with `bcrypt`
- CORS, Helmet for request security
- Environment variables for sensitive configs

### 14. Deployment & CI/CD
- MongoDB Atlas in production mode
- Ready for deployment to Vercel/Netlify (frontend) and Railway/Heroku (backend)
- Build scripts (`npm run build`) and `.env` usage

### 15. Documentation & Testing
- Clear inline code comments & naming
- Route files include endpoint info
- JSDoc-style comments in backend
- Project structure supports unit/integration testing

### 16. Additional Enhancements
- Responsive design (media queries)
- User feedback with loading/error states
- Visual API interactions (Network tab + messages)
